Ask for 2 input values from the following:

MU or GM and 1 of COG;GP;SP
Any 2 of COG;GP;SP

Determine which 2 values have been entered

Call Calc function passing the entered values and types  ( Ex. Calc (COG, 100.00, MU, 150.00))

Function Calc(Name1 As String, Value As Single, Name2 As String, Value2 As Single)

Select Case Type1 & Type2
  Case COG & MU
	SP = COG+(COG*MU)
	GP = SP-COG
	GM = GP/SP
  Case COG & GP
	SP = COG+GP
	GM = GP/SP
	MU = GP/COG
  Case COG & GM
	GP = COG*(GM/(1-GM))
	SP = COG+GP
	MU = GP/COG
  Case COG & SP
	GP = SP-COG
	GM = GP/SP
	MU = GP/COG
  Case MU & GP
	COG = GP/MU
	SP = COG+GP
	GM = GP/SP
  Case MU & GM
	MsgBox("This calculation is not possible. Please enter MU OR GM and any other value.")
  Case MU & SP
	COG = SP/(1+MU)
	GP = COG*MU
	GM = GP / SP
  Case GP & GM
	SP = GP/GM
	COG = SP-GP
	MU = GP/COG
  Case GP & SP
	COG = SP-GP
	MU = GP/COG
	GM = GP/SP
  Case GM & SP
	GP = SP*GM
	COG = SP-GP
	MU = GP/COG
End Select
